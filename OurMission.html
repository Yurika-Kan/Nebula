        <p>As undergraduate students, it feels like whenever we are reading a research paper we are constantly pausing to ask ourselves, What does this even mean? Every five seconds, we're stuck checking definitions for confusing jargon and repeatedly re-reading paragraphs just to grasp the content of the paper.</p>
        <p>Our goal with NebulaNotes was to make research papers accessible to all. Now you can look up annotated versions of the research paper of your choice. These versions can make papers easier to digest and understand.
